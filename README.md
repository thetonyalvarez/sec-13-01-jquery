# jQuery DOM Practice

## Part One

In this exercise, you’ll write some jQuery statements to perform some DOM manipulation

Complete the following steps in the following file:

[**_index.html_**](index.html)

1. When the DOM is ready, console.log the message “Let’s get ready to party with jQuery!”
2. Give all images inside of an article tag the class of image-center (this class is defined inside of the style tag in the head).
3. Remove the last paragraph in the article.
4. Set the font size of the title to be a random pixel size from 0 to 100.
5. Add an item to the list; it can say whatever you want.
6. Scratch that; the list is silly. Empty the aside and put a paragraph in it apologizing for the list’s existence.
7. When you change the numbers in the three inputs on the bottom, the background color of the body should change to match whatever the three values in the inputs are.
8. Add an event listener so that when you click on the image, it is removed from the DOM.

## Part Two - Movies App!

Build an application that uses jQuery to do the following:

-   Contains a form with two inputs for a title and rating along with a button to submit the form.
-   When the form is submitted, capture the values for each of the inputs and append them to the DOM along with a button to remove each title and rating from the DOM.
-   When the button to remove is clicked, remove each title and rating from the DOM.

## Further Study

-   Ensure that the rating of a movie can only be between 0 and 10.
-   Ensure that a title has at least 2 characters in it.
-   Allow users to sort alphabetically by the title of the movie or by the rating of the movie from lowest to highest and vice versa.
